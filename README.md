## Syiào Méi

A constructed language for the fictional culture of domestic cats.

**Syiào Méi** “Traditions of the Brothers and Sisters” or **Syiào Qhānn** „Traditions of the Hunter”.

This repository contains the word lists, etymology and corpus of the language.

Currently the language is under development and not permitted to be used outside of the context 
of derivative works of my fictional culture. Fan contributions are welcome.
